Query String
 - Query string is syntax where we can send parameter values from the browser 
   to the server.
 - Query strings and routing are ways to receive argument values sent from the browser
   to the server.
   Example: GET /dashboard?id=1 HTTP/1.1   
   Host: www.website.com
   Accept: text/html

    - id=1 is the query string
    - a question mark ? separates the request URL path (/dashboard) and the query string.
    - A query string is usually attached to the URL in GET requests only.

    - & in the url separates query string values pairs.
      localhost:5000/?id=001&name=john&age=47
