HTTP
 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol
 - HTTP is a set of rules that enables browser (client) to send requests, and enables 
   servers to send a response.
 - A browser sends requests to a server on the form of an HTTP request.
 - The request sent (the HTTP request) follows a set of rules.
 - In ASP.Net, the client sends a request to the Kestrel server, the Kestrel server
   in return, forwards that response to the app code, and response back to the client.
 
 - HTTP Responses
  - HTTP response format:
    Status code
    Response Header
    Empty Line
    Response Body

   - Kestrel server prepares a response when a browser sends a request.
   - HTTP/1.1 200 OK is the HTTP version number or the status code response from the 
     server. 
     - HTTP/1.1 is the protocol
     - 200 is the status code.
     - OK is the status description.

  - Response Headers
   - A response Header contains a key: value pairs.
    - Key: Value
    - Content-Type:  type of request.  (text/html, or could be text/plain, or a file.)

   - Response Body
    - Contains the actual information sent from the browser to the server.
    - Example:
        app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!!!");
        - "Hello World!!!" is the response body in the above example.
        - Usually the response body is a file content.

- Common HTTP status code classes:
  1xxs – Informational responses: The server is thinking through the request.
   - Switching Protocols

  2xxs – Success! The request was successfully completed and the server gave the browser 
        the expected response.
   - 200 OK

  3xxs – Redirection: You got redirected somewhere else. The request was received, but 
        there’s a redirect of some kind.
   - 302 Found
   - 304 Not Modified

  4xxs – Client errors: Page not found. The site or page couldn’t be reached. (The request 
        was made, but the page isn’t valid — this is an error on the website’s side of 
        the conversation and often appears when a page doesn’t exist on the site.)    
    - 400 Bad request
    - 401 Unauthorized
    - 404 Not Found

  5xxs – Server errors: Failure. A valid request was made by the client but the server 
        failed to complete the request.
    - 500 Internal Server Error
