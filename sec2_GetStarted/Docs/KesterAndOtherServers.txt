Kestrel and other servers

 - ASP.Net requires a server in order to receive requests and send responses.
 - Kestrel is the default server for ASP.Net applications.
 - Kestrel acts as both a development and a real application server.
 - an application server receives requests from the Web (Internet).
 - In development we use Kestrel server.  
 - Kestrel does not support load balancing and URL rewriting.

 - In production we use Reverse Proxy servers (IIS, Nginx, or Apache).
 - IIS receives requests from the Internet, and forward them to Kestrel.
 - IIS Express is a light version of IIS.
 - IIS is supported only by Windows.
 - Nginx and Apache are supported by Linux and Windows OSs.

 - We can simulate the features of Reverse Proxy Servers during development, by
   using a dummy proxy server called IIS Express.
 - IIS Express simulates IIS, and acts as a proxy server, which can receive a 
   request and forward it to Kestrel.
 - Both IIS and IIS Express are supported by Windows OS only.

 -  We can start the Kestrel server by running command: $ dotnet run 
    in the Terminal.

 - IIS and IISExpress has more advanced features than Kestrel.
