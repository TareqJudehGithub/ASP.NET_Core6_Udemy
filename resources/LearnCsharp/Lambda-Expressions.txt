Lambda Expressions
 - Introduced in C# v3.0
 - Lambda expression is an anonymous method, but offers more convenient syntax. 
 - Lambda expressions can be invoked using the delegate variable or an event, much
   like anonymous methods.
 - Lambda expression uses the arrow (=>) operator, thats why it is called a Lambda
   expression.
 -  Lambda expression can have parameters and local variables.
 - Lambda expression can return a value.
 - Lambda expression will not have any name.
