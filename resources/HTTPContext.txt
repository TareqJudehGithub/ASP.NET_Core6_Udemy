HttpContext
 - A type of object that is created automatically upon receiving a request from the 
   client.
 - When the client sends a request to Kestrel server, the Kestrel server forwards that
   request to the ASP.Net app. The app in return creates an HttpContext object.
 - The object contains information related to the client request, response, and other
   details.
