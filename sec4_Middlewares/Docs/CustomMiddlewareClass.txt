Custom Middleware Class

- For large projects, it is better practice to keep all middleware(s) in 
  a separate file(custom class).
- The middleware class has to implement an interface called IMiddleware
  in order to indicate that, this class is a middleware.

      class MiddlewareClassName : IMiddleware
      {
        public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context, requestDelegate next)
        {
          //before logic
          await next(context);

          //after logic          
        }
      }
