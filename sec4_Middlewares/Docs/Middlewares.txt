Middleware(s)
 - A middleware is component that is assembled into the application pipeline to handle
   requests and responses.
 - Middleware(s) are chained one-after-other and execute in the same sequence
   they're added in (top to bottom).
 - Each middleware perform a single action/operation, applying the single responsibility
   principle.
 - The purpose/goal of middleware(s), is that each middleware can perform
   individual single responsibility.  
 - Middleware(s) takes two shapes:
  - A request delegate (anonymous method or a lambda expression).
  - The middleware can also be a class.
