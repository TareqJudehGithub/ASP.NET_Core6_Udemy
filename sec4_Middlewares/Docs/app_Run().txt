app.Run() middleware
 - app.Run() is used to execute a terminating/short-circuiting middleware that doesn't
   forward the request to the next middleware (cannot use next() method).
   Thats why we can't have two app.Run()
   middleware(s); only one of them will be executed (the one on top).
 
 - App.Run() middleware does not forward requests to the subsequent appRun() 
   middleware(s).   
 - Forwarding middleware(s) requests can be optional. For that we can use 
   app.Use().
