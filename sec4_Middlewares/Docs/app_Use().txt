app.Use() middleware /Middleware(s) Chain
 - app.Use() can forward request and responses to subsequent middleware(S).
 - app.Use() can also terminate/short-use execute a middleware.

 - app.Use() receives two parameters
  - The first parameter contains the HTTP content (request/response).
  - The 2nd parameter is a request delegate, which represents the subsequent middleware
    which the request/response will be forwarded to (the next middleware in order).
    
  app.Use(async (HttpContext context, requestDelegate next) => {
      await context.Response.WriteAsync("");
      await next(context) // In order to pass/forward, both parameters
                             in HttpContext & requestDelegate must match.      
  });
 
  app.Run(async(HttpContext context) => {
      await context.Response.WriteAsync("app.Run() middleware");
  });
